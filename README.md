# Fast-Iterative-Solvers
 Fast Iterative Solvers rely on some methods and math techniques to solve Finite Element problems faster when compared to direct solvers. Especially for large-scale problems that arise in Finite Element simulations. They are designed to accelerate the convergence of the iterative process.

1. GMRES (Generalized Minimal Residual Method):
GMRES is an iterative method designed to solve linear systems of equations. It aims to minimize the residual over a Krylov subspace, which is the subspace generated by repeatedly applying the matrix to a starting vector.
Mathematical Technique:
Krylov Subspace: GMRES constructs a Krylov subspace by iteratively generating a set of orthonormal basis vectors through the application of the coefficient matrix and the residual vector. This subspace allows for finding a solution in a direction not connected to previous ones, improving convergence.
Orthogonalization: The orthogonalization process ensures that the new direction is orthogonal to the previously known directions in the subspace, enhancing numerical stability and convergence.

2. Conjugate Gradients (CG):
Conjugate Gradients is another iterative method to solve linear systems, often used for symmetric positive definite matrices.
Mathematical Technique:
Conjugacy: CG operates by finding a conjugate direction in each iteration. The direction of each iteration is conjugate to the directions of the previous iterations, allowing for efficient convergence.
Minimization of Quadratic Function: CG minimizes a quadratic function associated with the linear system, effectively solving the system in fewer iterations compared to some other iterative methods.

3. Multigrid:
Multigrid is a multilevel method used for solving large linear systems arising from discretized partial differential equations.
Mathematical Technique:
Grid Hierarchy: Multigrid employs a hierarchy of grids (coarse to fine) to solve the problem. It starts by solving the problem on a coarse grid, then iteratively refines the solution by moving to finer grids.
Residual Correction: It exploits the smoothness of the error by using residual information from a coarse grid to correct the solution on a finer grid. This correction is done via restriction (coarse to fine) and prolongation (fine to coarse).

4. Power Iteration (for Eigensolvers):
Power Iteration is a method for finding the largest eigenvalue and its associated eigenvector of a matrix.
Mathematical Technique:
Eigenvalue Approximation: Power Iteration repeatedly applies the matrix to a starting vector and normalizes the resulting vectors. Over iterations, the dominant eigenvector (associated with the largest eigenvalue) is approximated.
Dominant Eigenvector: The method converges towards the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue, making it useful for estimating dominant modes in various applications.
