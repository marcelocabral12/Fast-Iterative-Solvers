# Fast-Iterative-Solvers
 Fast Iterative Solvers rely in some methods and math techniques to solve Finite Element problems faster when compared to direct solvers. Especially for large-scale problems that arise in Finite Element simulations. They are designed to accelerate the convergence of the iterative process.
